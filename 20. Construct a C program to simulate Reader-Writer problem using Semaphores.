Readers-Writers Problem in C using pthreads and semaphores

I'm trying to create the readers-writers scenario through C code but I'm stuck at trying to break off the readers code in the middle so that a reader does not just enter and exit, it stays and more readers can add.

My current program doesn't enter more than one reader, as soon as one enters, it will leave then writer would come.

I've tried using sleep() but including unistd library really destroys half the code with errors

#include<semaphore.h>
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
sem_t x,y;
pthread_t tid;
pthread_t writerthreads[100],readerthreads[100];
int readercount;

void *reader(void* param)
{
    sem_wait(&x);
    readercount++;
    if(readercount==1)
    sem_wait(&y);
    sem_post(&x);
    printf("\n%d reader is inside",readercount);
    sem_wait(&x);
    readercount--;
    if(readercount==0)
    {
        sem_post(&y);
    }
    sem_post(&x);
    printf("\n%d Reader is leaving",readercount+1);
}

void *writer(void* param)
{
    printf("\nWriter is trying to enter");
    sem_wait(&y);
    printf("\nWriter has entered");
    sem_post(&y);
    printf("\nWriter is leaving");
}
